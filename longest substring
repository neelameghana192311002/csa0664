ALGORITHM LongestSubstringWithoutRepeatingCharacters(s)

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters in a given string.

    INPUT:
        s: a string
    OUTPUT:
        an integer representing the length of the longest substring without repeating characters

    BEGIN:
        lastSeen <- empty dictionary
        start <- 0
        maxLength <- 0

        FOR i <- 0 to length of s - 1 DO
            IF s[i] is in lastSeen AND lastSeen[s[i]] >= start THEN
                start <- lastSeen[s[i]] + 1
            END IF

            lastSeen[s[i]] <- i
            maxLength <- max(maxLength, i - start + 1)
        END FOR

        RETURN maxLength
    END
