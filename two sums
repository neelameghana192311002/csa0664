ALGORITHM TwoSum(nums, target)

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
Find indices of two numbers in the array nums that add up to the integer target, ensuring each input has exactly one solution and not using the same element twice.

    INPUT: 
        nums: array of integers
        target: integer
    OUTPUT:
        array of two integers representing the indices

    BEGIN:
        dictionary <- empty dictionary
        FOR i <- 0 to length of nums - 1 DO
            complement <- target - nums[i]
            IF complement is in dictionary THEN
                RETURN [dictionary[complement], i]
          
            dictionary[nums[i]] <- i
        END FOR
        RETURN []
    END
